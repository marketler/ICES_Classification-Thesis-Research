# ICES_Classification-Thesis-Research
This repository is used to showcase all code for my thesis research for obtaining my masters degree in Business Information Technology - Data Science &amp; Business

The pdf file "Exploring fishing vessel activity classification using machine learning - M. Ros 2022" is the final thesis report. More context about this project can be found there.

The "Data" folder contains the three folders containing the ICES research data (HERAS, IBWSS, IESSNS). The data is seperated into the acoustic and biotic folder.
The "Oman_AIS" folder contains the Oman data in three .txt files while also containing some of the files generated by the notebook code.

Then there are 2 files for the data engineering:
- SPA_Data_edit.ipynb
- SDA_Data_edit.ipynb

These files create the final datasets needed for the models, "Data/full_set_SPA.csv" and "Data/full_set_SDA.csv".

These models can be found in files:
- SPA_Models.ipynb
- SDA_Models.ipynb

Finally, the route_to_kml.ipynb is used to generate kml files of the routes for Google Earth.
